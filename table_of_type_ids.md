# Table of reserved type ids

Type id reservations are done in batches of 10. The x stands for any digit.

If you are creating a Dart that needs to register custom type adapters and that's intended to be published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev), don't hesitate to file a pull request adding it to this table.

Consider containing something like the following in your package:

```dart
extension MyPackageBinary on BinaryApi {
  void initializeMyPackage() {
    TypeRegistry.registerAdapters({
      ...
    });
  }
}
```

Users can then call `binary.initializeMyPackage()`.

| -1 â€“ -9  | `dart:core`       |
| -1x      | `dart:core`       |
| -2x      | `dart:core`       |
